# opengl
A C++ OpenGL project I made by learning about it from The Cherno (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) 
I wanted to learn about graphic programming in C++ and how to give a graphics card instructions to draw something on screen. I came across many OpenGL tutorials and
project but the one by The Cherno seemed to be the easiest to follow so I did everithing in the tutorial and after that put my newly acquired knowledge to use by making
a cube with colorful sides that can be rotated, translated and scaled to will.
